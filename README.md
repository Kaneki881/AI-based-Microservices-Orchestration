Java application that implements an AI-based microservices orchestration system

created a basic implementation of an AI-based microservices orchestration system. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1-Microservice Class:

Represents individual microservices
-Tracks metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and request count
-Maintains service status (RUNNING, STOPPED, SCALING)


2-RLModel (Reinforcement Learning Model):

-Implements a simple Q-learning based decision-making system

-Predicts actions based on service metrics

-Updates the model based on rewards from previous actions


3-Orchestrator:

-Manages multiple microservices

-Monitors service performance

-Executes scaling decisions based on the RL model's predictions


4-Main Application:

-Sets up the orchestration system

-Registers sample microservices

-Includes a load simulator for testing
